### Whom should a customer buy from if they want help to migrate, run, and optimize their cloud workloads?

- ~~Direct from AWS, which is always the easiest and most cost-effective solution~~
- **An AWS Partner who can work with the customer to design, build, run, and optimize their cloud environment**
- ~~No one, because in the cloud model a customer manages these things themselves~~
- ~~Any IT provider who has experience working in IT infrastructure~~

> **Explanation:**
> The correct response option is **"An AWS Partner who can work with the customer to design, build, run, and optimize their cloud environment."**
>
> AWS Partners are certified experts who have the necessary skills and experience to help customers successfully migrate to the cloud, manage their workloads, and continuously optimize their cloud environment. These partners can provide tailored solutions that align with the specific needs and goals of the customer, ensuring a smooth transition and effective cloud operations.
>
> The other options are incorrect because:
>
> - While buying directly from AWS might be a viable option for some businesses, it doesn't provide the personalized support and expertise that an AWS Partner offers, especially during complex migrations or optimizations.
> - Managing everything independently can be challenging, particularly for businesses without deep cloud expertise. Relying on an experienced partner can significantly reduce risks and improve outcomes.
> - Not every IT provider has the specific knowledge or certifications required to handle AWS cloud environments effectively. AWS Partners are specially trained and certified to work with AWS technologies.

### Which best describes what customers buy when they purchase cloud?

- ~~Physical assets tailored to their needs~~
- **Access to standardized compute, storage, database, and other IT services, which run in a cloud service provider’s data centers**
- ~~Fixed assets that cannot be changed or customized over the life of the contract~~
- ~~Access to standardized compute, storage, database, and other IT services, which run in a customer’s data centers~~

> **Explanation:**
> The correct response option is **"Access to standardized compute, storage, database, and other IT services, which run in a cloud service provider’s data centers."**
>
> When customers purchase cloud services, they are buying access to a suite of standardized IT services—such as compute, storage, and databases—that are hosted and managed by a cloud service provider (CSP) in the provider's data centers. These services are scalable, flexible, and can be customized to meet the evolving needs of the customer without the need for them to manage the underlying physical infrastructure.
>
> The other options are incorrect because:
>
> - Cloud services are not physical assets; instead, they are virtualized resources that can be scaled and managed dynamically.
> - Cloud services offer flexibility, allowing customers to adjust their usage as needed, unlike fixed assets that are static and cannot be easily changed.
> - Cloud services typically run in the data centers of the cloud service provider, not in the customer’s data centers, which is a key benefit of using cloud computing.

### Who should be engaged in a customer’s organization to help ensure successful cloud adoption?

- ~~Procurement lead~~
- ~~Chief information officer (CIO) or chief technology officer (CTO)~~
- ~~Legal department~~
- **All stakeholders, such as Policy, IT, Procurement, HR and Training, Legal, Security and Compliance**

> **Explanation:**
> The correct response option is **"All stakeholders, such as Policy, IT, Procurement, HR and Training, Legal, Security and Compliance."**
>
> Successful cloud adoption requires a coordinated effort across the entire organization. Engaging all relevant stakeholders ensures that the transition to the cloud is smooth, comprehensive, and aligned with the organization’s strategic goals. Each department has a role to play, from IT for technical implementation, to Legal for compliance and contract management, to HR for training and change management. Involving all stakeholders helps to address concerns, align resources, and establish a unified approach to cloud adoption.
>
> The other options are incorrect because:
>
> - While the procurement lead, CIO/CTO, and legal department play important roles, cloud adoption affects the entire organization. Limiting engagement to just one or a few departments can lead to gaps in planning, execution, and management.
> - A successful cloud strategy requires collaboration across multiple disciplines to address the various aspects of cloud adoption, from technical to legal, to human resources.

### Which best describes cloud pricing?

- ~~Fixed, with no upfront costs or commitment~~
- **Variable, with no upfront costs or required commitments**
- ~~Variable, with no upfront costs and a 3-year commitment~~
- ~~Fixed, with upfront costs and a 3-year commitment~~

> **Explanation:**
> The correct response option is **"Variable, with no upfront costs or required commitments."**
>
> Cloud pricing is typically variable, meaning that customers pay only for the resources they use, with no upfront costs or long-term commitments required. This flexibility allows organizations to scale their usage up or down based on their needs, optimizing costs and avoiding the financial burden of paying for unused resources. While there are options for committing to longer-term contracts for potential cost savings (like Reserved Instances), the most common cloud pricing model is pay-as-you-go with no required commitments.
>
> The other options are incorrect because:
>
> - Fixed pricing models are less common in cloud services, which emphasize flexibility and scalability.
> - Variable pricing with a required commitment, such as a 3-year contract, does exist (e.g., Reserved Instances), but it is not the best description of the general cloud pricing model, which typically does not require commitments.
> - Fixed pricing with upfront costs and long-term commitments is more characteristic of traditional IT infrastructure rather than cloud services.

### Which best describes the cloud security shared responsibility model?

- **Cloud service providers are responsible for security of the cloud, and customers are responsible for security in the cloud.**
- ~~Customers are responsible for security of the cloud, and cloud service providers are responsible for security in the cloud.~~
- ~~Cloud service providers are responsible for both security of the cloud and security in the cloud.~~
- ~~Customers are responsible for security of the cloud and security in the cloud.~~

> **Explanation:**
> The correct response option is **"Cloud service providers are responsible for security of the cloud, and customers are responsible for security in the cloud."**
>
> In the shared responsibility model, cloud service providers like AWS are responsible for the security **of** the cloud, which includes the physical security of the data centers, the infrastructure, and the hardware that run the services. On the other hand, customers are responsible for security **in** the cloud, which includes managing their data, configuring security settings, managing identity and access, and ensuring that their applications are secure.
>
> The other options are incorrect because:
>
> - Cloud service providers are not responsible for securing customer data or configurations within the cloud environment; that responsibility lies with the customer.
> - Customers are not responsible for the underlying infrastructure and physical security, which is managed by the cloud provider.

### Which best describes how a customer should incorporate cloud-friendly terms and conditions into an RFx process?

- ~~Use IT hardware terms and conditions because they are similar to cloud terms and conditions.~~
- ~~Use the same terms and conditions for cloud service providers, cloud-managed service providers, and resellers because they all use the same model.~~
- **Engage cloud service providers early to get the best fit. Resolve differences, incorporate, and use the cloud service provider’s terms to the fullest extent possible to avoid misalignment.**
- ~~Engage cloud service providers after the RFx.~~

> **Explanation:**
> The correct response option is **"Engage cloud service providers early to get the best fit. Resolve differences, incorporate, and use the cloud service provider’s terms to the fullest extent possible to avoid misalignment."**
>
> Incorporating cloud-friendly terms and conditions into an RFx (Request for Information, Request for Proposal, etc.) process requires early engagement with cloud service providers. This allows the customer to understand the specific terms and conditions that apply to cloud services, which can be significantly different from those used for traditional IT hardware or services. By resolving differences early and aligning the RFx with the cloud provider’s terms, the customer can avoid potential misalignments and ensure that the contractual terms are suitable for the cloud environment.
>
> The other options are incorrect because:
>
> - IT hardware terms and conditions are not appropriate for cloud services, as they do not account for the unique aspects of cloud computing.
> - Cloud service providers, managed service providers, and resellers may have different models and terms, so a one-size-fits-all approach is not effective.
> - Engaging cloud service providers after the RFx can lead to misalignment and missed opportunities to tailor the terms to better suit the cloud environment.
