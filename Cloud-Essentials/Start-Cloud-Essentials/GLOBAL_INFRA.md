### Which statement best describes traditional on-premises environments?

- **You are responsible for purchasing hardware to match your capacity needs.**
- ~~You do not have to pay for any capacity storage that you don't use.~~
- ~~Servers come configured to meet your needs after you place your order.~~
- ~~With on-premises environments, you do not need to wait for the servers to be delivered to your site.~~

> **Explanation:**
> A challenge with an on-premises environment is that if there is not enough capacity, you must purchase more and wait for the servers to be delivered to your site. However, you do have to pay for any capacity storage that you don't use. With a traditional on-premises environment, servers do not necessarily come configured to meet your needs after you place your order. If you have too much capacity, you are left with an overprovisioned environment. With on-premises environments, you do need to wait for the servers to be delivered to your site.

### What are the three key benefits of using cloud computing? (Select THREE.)

- ~~Physical access to servers~~
- **Dynamic abilities**
- **Pay as you go**
- ~~Control of the configuration of part of your network~~
- **Programmable resources**
- ~~Infrastructure (physical hardware) taken care of by your business~~

> **Explanation:**
> With cloud computing, you have dynamic abilities, pay as you go, and programmable resources. With cloud computing, you do not have physical access to servers. You control the configuration of your entire network. The infrastructure (physical hardware) is taken care of by the cloud vendor, not your business.

### Which statement best describes an AWS data center?

- ~~An AWS data center cannot house more than 100 servers.~~
- **An AWS data center is where your hardware is located. It typically houses thousands of servers.**
- ~~An Availability Zone will consist of at least 100 data centers.~~
- ~~AWS data centers are not designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels.~~

> **Explanation:**
> AWS resources are launched on the AWS Global Infrastructure starting with the data center. This is where your hardware is located. It typically houses thousands of servers. AWS data centers are designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels. In case of failure, automated processes move traffic away from the affected area. Core applications are deployed to an N+1 standard so that in the event of a data center failure, there is sufficient capacity for traffic to be load-balanced to the remaining sites.
