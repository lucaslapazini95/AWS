### Which of these are benefits associated with serverless resources? (Select THREE.)

- **There are no physical servers to provision or manage.**
- **Serverless resources can scale based on usage.**
- ~~You have to pay for idle servers.~~
- **Serverless resources come with built-in availability.**
- ~~Serverless resources do not come with built-in fault tolerance.~~
- ~~Serverless resources do not scale.~~

> **Explanation:**
> There are no physical servers to provision or manage. Serverless resources can scale based on usage. Serverless resources come with built-in availability. However, you do not have to pay for idle servers. Serverless resources do come with built-in fault tolerance.

### What are advantages of AWS Lambda? (Select THREE.)

- **Lambda offers per-millisecond pricing of the code being run.**
- ~~Lambda supports two languages.~~
- **Lambda can run your code in response to events.**
- ~~Lambda provides medium availability.~~
- ~~Lambda offers per-minute pricing of the code being run.~~
- **Lambda can run your code on a schedule.**

> **Explanation:**
> Lambda offers per-millisecond pricing of the code being run. Lambda can run your code on a schedule. Lambda can run your code in response to events. However, Lambda supports multiple languages and provides high availability.

### What are the benefits of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling? (Select THREE.)

- **With Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can add or remove EC2 instances and unhealthy applications automatically and replace the instances without intervention.**
- **You can scale horizontally to precisely match the current demand and avoid overprovisioning or underprovisioning.**
- ~~You will need to physically monitor and adjust capacities continuously.~~
- ~~With Amazon EC2, you can add or remove EC2 instances and unhealthy applications and replace the instances with intervention.~~
- **The service will be able to match the demand in a live manner.**
- ~~Amazon EC2 does not need to maintain and scale the fleet of nodes running your containers.~~

### What are three main benefits of Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)? (Select THREE.)

- **Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS give you a centralized way of monitoring and controlling how you want your containers launched.**
- **Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service to run Kubernetes in the AWS Cloud and on-premises data centers. In the cloud, Amazon EKS automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane nodes responsible for scheduling containers, managing application availability, storing cluster data, and other key tasks. With Amazon EKS, you can take advantage of all the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS infrastructure and the integrations with AWS networking and security services.**
- ~~Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS give you a decentralized way of monitoring and controlling how you want your containers launched.~~
- ~~Amazon EKS does not need to be fully managed.~~
- **Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. It deeply integrates with the rest of the AWS platform to provide a secure and easy-to-use solution for running container workloads in the cloud and now on your infrastructure with Amazon ECS Anywhere.**
- ~~Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS add to the complexity of standing up the infrastructure.~~

> **Explanation:**
> Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS give you a centralized way of monitoring and controlling how you want your containers launched. If you have in-house skills running Kubernetes, there is a fully managed Amazon EKS for you. Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS are container orchestrating services that help you schedule the fleet of nodes running your containers. Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS remove the complexity of standing up the infrastructure.
